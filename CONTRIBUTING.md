# Spotify-api.js

So before you attempt to contribute, you can get a clear idea where to make changes.

- As the package is made in Typescript, you need to update in `src/` folder. Make sure to compile it in `dist/`. Or else mention in pull request.

- Do not make changes to `.npmignore`, `.gitignore` or `tsconfig.json`. If you do, make sure to mention why and what in Pull Request Description.

- Make sure your changes are well documented.

- If you are not sure, always make an issue before making the pull request.

- Make sure your test files only in a `test/` folder.

- Remember suggesting any change to the package or creating any pull request would take around 25 days of time to be updated in the package. So kindly have the patience.

**Happy Contributing!**
