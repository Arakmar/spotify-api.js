# Spotify-api.js Testing

This is a section where you can test the module! Whenever you are doing a pull request. Put your credentails in `env.json` in the `tests` folder here

```json
{
    "id": "client id",
    "secret": "client secret"
}
```

Then run `npm run test` which will display the test results. Check if all tests are passed are fine! This is not required but preferred whenever a change occurs!
